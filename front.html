            <h2>Why you should use our Application?</h2>
            <p>Improper posture detection falls within the domains of Healthcare and Physical therapy, addressing issues like back pain, neck strain, and reduced mobility. Correcting posture is crucial for preventing musculoskeletal problems and promoting overall well-being. Prolonged poor posture can lead to permanent deformation of bones and muscles. In today's professional landscape, long working hours contribute to improper posture, significantly impacting health. Ergonomic principles emphasize proper body orientation to alleviate pressure on joints and muscles. This is especially relevant in office settings, where extended sitting and inadequate workstation setup can result in pain, discomfort, fatigue, and long-term health issues. Identifying and correcting bad postures also play a vital role in healing and preventing additional injuries in physical therapy and rehabilitation contexts.</p>
